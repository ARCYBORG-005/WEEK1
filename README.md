### *Steps to Open a CSV in Power BI and Perform Data Transformations*

1. *Open Power BI Desktop*  
   Launch Power BI Desktop on your system.

2. *Import the CSV File*  
   - Click on *Home > Get Data > Text/CSV*.
   - Browse and select your CSV file.
   - Click *Open* to load the file.

3. *Preview the Data*  
   - Power BI will display a preview of the data.  
   - If everything looks fine, click *Load* to import the data into Power BI.
   - If you want to transform the data first, click *Transform Data* instead.

4. *Open Power Query Editor*  
   - If you clicked *Load, go to **Home > Transform Data* to open the Power Query Editor.
   - If you clicked *Transform Data*, you're already in the Power Query Editor.

5. *Remove a Column*  
   - In the Power Query Editor, locate the column you want to remove.
   - Right-click on the column header and select *Remove*.
   - Alternatively, select the column and click on the *Remove Columns* button in the ribbon.

6. *Apply Data Transformations*  
   - Perform other transformations if needed, such as renaming columns, filtering rows, or splitting data.
   - Ensure all changes are recorded in the *Applied Steps* pane on the right side.

7. *Load the Transformed Data*  
   - Once you're done transforming, click *Close & Apply* in the top-left corner of the Power Query Editor.  
   - The transformed data will now be loaded into Power BI.

8. *Save Your Work*  
   - Save your Power BI project as a .pbix file by clicking *File > Save As*.
   - Give it a meaningful name (e.g., PowerBI_Sustainability_Week1.pbix).
